Hi! It is boring to wash the dishes. Luckily, half of them are already clean. Train a classifier to determine clean ones to save time for the new machine learning course ;)

It is a few shot learning competition. We have a dataset of 20 clean and 20 dirty plates in train and hundreds of plates in test. Good luck!
